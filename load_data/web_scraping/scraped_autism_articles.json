In 2021, the CDC reported that 1 in 44 children in the US is diagnosed with ASD. It is more common in boys than girls (1 in 27 boys, 1 in 116 girls). Individuals with ASD can show a wide variety of behavioral symptoms, from failure to develop appropriate peer relationships to a delay in or a total lack of spoken language. For individuals who do speak, there may be a repetitive use of language or a delay in the ability to sustain a conversation with others. Symptoms of autism can also include hyperactivity, short attention span, impulsivity, aggressiveness, self-injurious behavior, and temper tantrums. Evidence-based autism treatment promotes the development of social and communication skills and minimizes behaviors that interfere with functioning and learning. Intensive, sustained, evidence-based autism treatment can increase an individual\u2019s ability to acquire language, learn, function in the community, and fulfill his/her potential. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is the most widely accepted reference used for the classification and diagnosis of ASD. The most recent edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013), redefined the diagnostic criteria for ASD, which was previously regarded as three distinct diagnoses (i.e., autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder\u2014not otherwise specified, and Asperger\u2019s disorder). The DSM-5, however, classifies ASD as a single disorder characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction, in addition to restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Signs And Symptoms The presentation and severity of symptoms vary widely among individuals with ASD. Early signs of ASD may be observed in an infant as young as 6 months old. Some common signs and symptoms of ASD include: Lack of eye contact Not responding appropriately to greetings Difficulty initiating and maintaining conversations with others Not responding appropriately to others\u2019 gestures and facial expressions Difficulty using gestures and facial expressions appropriately Appearing to be unaware of others\u2019 feelings Not engaging in pretend play Preferring to play alone Repeating sounds, words, or phrases out of context Becoming distressed by minor changes in routines Performing repetitive movements,\u00a0such as hand\u2013flapping\u00a0or rocking Playing with toys in unusual ways, e.g., spinning them or lining them up Having unusually strong attachments to particular objects Limiting conversations to very specific topics Exhibiting oversensitivity to sounds or textures Appearing to be indifferent to pain Experiencing delays or plateaus in skill development Losing previously acquired skills Displaying challenging behaviors, such as aggression, tantrums, and self-injury The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised (M-CHAT-R) is a free, validated screening tool that assesses an individual\u2019s risk for ASD. If you have concerns about your child\u2019s development, express your concerns immediately to your child\u2019s pediatrician and request a referral to a specialist who can perform more thorough assessments. Prevalence The factors contributing to increases in reported rates of ASD are not fully understood. While increased rates may be partially explained by improved screening and diagnostic practices, researchers are also exploring the roles of various environmental and genetic risk factors. The prevalence of ASD has increased more than 150% since 2000. CDC statistics reveal that ASD is present across all races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic groups. In addition, boys are more likely to develop ASD than girls. Risk Factors There is no single known cause for ASD. Rather, evidence suggests that there are many factors involved in the development of ASD. Researchers are actively exploring the roles of various genetic and environmental risk factors. Genetics have been found to play a significant role in the development of ASD. Evidence indicates that siblings of individuals with ASD are at an increased risk of developing ASD themselves. Research conducted on twins has found genetics to play a sizable role in the development of ASD. Additionally, rates of ASD are higher among individuals with various genetic disorders, including fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. Numerous gene mutations have been found to increase the risk of developing ASD by varying degrees. Sometimes, gene mutations are inherited from a parent who carries the same gene mutation other times gene mutations occur spontaneously. Advanced parental age , another risk factor for ASD, may increase the chance of genetic mutations that occur spontaneously as genetic material is copied over from parent to offspring. In addition to genetic factors, a number of environmental factors have been found to increase the risk of developing ASD. Many environmental risk factors consist of prenatal exposures, including maternal contact with high levels of air pollution , maternal viral and bacterial infections and maternal ingestion of some prescription drugs including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, a type of antidepressant. On the other hand, prenatal vitamins ingested during pregnancy and the months preceding pregnancy have been found to reduce the risk of ASD. Birth complications involving oxygen deprivation are also associated with an increased risk of ASD. Treatment Intensive behavioral intervention (IBI) using the principles and procedures of applied behavior analysis (ABA) is the only empirically validated treatment for ASD. ABA is conducted at a high intensity, typically between 30 and 40 hours per week, for multiple years. Evidence suggests that greater treatment intensity leads to superior outcomes. Evidence also indicates that ABA is more effective if initiated in early development; however, services initiated at any age are beneficial for the acquisition of valuable skills.

ABA is based upon the principles of Behavior Analysis, which state that all behavior is shaped by its interaction with the environment. Simply speaking, behavior is greatly influenced by the consequences that follow it. If a behavior is followed by something pleasant, that behavior is likely to increase over time. Therefore, ABA uses positive consequences, or \u201cpositive reinforcement\u201d to teach and strengthen new, desired skills and behaviors, which then leads to positive behavior change and growth. Top quality ABA programs utilize both structured (DTT) and naturalistic (NET) teaching strategies to provide optimal learning activities for each patient. For most individuals, both types of teaching are needed to provide a successful learning environment that will result in learning new skills that the child can use in everyday life.\u00a0 Additionally, ABA programs approach teaching new skills by breaking them down into small steps which are easier to learn. Those steps are then linked together to form more complex skills that the individual can then successfully perform. Learning activities and targets are individually selected, designed, and progressed according to the needs of each person, therefore every ABA program is uniquely tailored for every learner. For more detailed descriptions of ABA, Discrete Trial Teaching, learning measurement procedures and more, see below. What is ABA? Behavior analysis is the scientific study of behavior. Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is the application of the principles of learning and motivation from behavior analysis, and the procedures and technology derived from those principles to the solution of problems of social significance. Many decades of research have validated treatments based on ABA. The Report of the Maine Administrators of Services for\u00a0Individuals with Disabilities (MADSEC) Autism Task Force (2000) provides a succinct description, put together by an independent body of experts: Over the past 40 years, several thousand published research studies have documented the effectiveness of ABA across a wide range of: Populations (individuals with mental illness, developmental disabilities and learning disorders), Interventionists (parents, teachers, and staff), Settings (schools, homes, institutions, group homes, hospitals, and business centers), and Behaviors (language, social, academic, leisure and functional life skills, aggression, self-injury, oppositional, and stereotyped behaviors) ABA is the process of systematically applying interventions based upon the principles of learning theory to improve socially significant behaviors to a meaningful degree and to demonstrate that the interventions employed are responsible for the improvement in behavior (Baer, Wolf & Risley, 1968; Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1991). At CARD\u00ae, all appropriate teaching approaches based on the well-grounded principles of ABA are utilized. Discrete Trial Training Discrete Trial Training (DTT) is a particular ABA teaching strategy that enables the learner to acquire complex skills and behaviors by first mastering the subcomponents of the targeted skill. For example, if one wishes to teach a individual to request a desired interaction as in \u201cI want to play,\u201d one might first teach subcomponents of this skill, such as the individual sounds comprising each word of the request or labeling enjoyable leisure activities as \u201cplay.\u201d By utilizing teaching techniques based on the principles of behavior analysis, the learner is gradually able to complete all subcomponent skills independently. Once the individual components are acquired, they are linked together to enable mastery of the targeted complex and functional skill. This methodology is highly effective in teaching basic communication, play, motor, and daily living skills. Initially, ABA programs for individuals with autism utilized only DTT, and the curriculum focused on teaching basic skills as noted above. However, ABA programs, such as the program implemented at the Center for Autism and Related Disorders (CARD\u00ae) , continue to evolve, placing greater emphasis on the generalization and spontaneity of skills learned. As patients progress and develop more complex social skills, the strict DTT approach gives way to treatments that include other components. Specifically, there are a number of weaknesses with DTT, including the fact that DTT is primarily teacher initiated, the reinforcers used to increase appropriate behavior are typically unrelated to the target response, and rote responding can often occur. Moreover, deficits in areas such as emotional understanding, perspective taking, and other executive functions, such as problem-solving skills, must also be addressed, and the DTT approach is not the most efficient means to do so. Although the DTT methodology is an integral part of ABA-based programs, other teaching strategies based on the principles of behavior analysis, such as Natural Environment Training (NET), may be used to address more complex skills. NET specifically addresses the above-mentioned weaknesses of DTT in that all skills are taught in a more natural environment in a more \u201cplayful manner.\u201d Moreover, the reinforcers used to increase appropriate responding are always directly related to the task; e.g., a individual is taught to say the word for a preferred item such as a \u201ccar\u201d and as a reinforcer is given access to the car contingent on making the correct response. NET is just one example of the different teaching strategies used in a comprehensive ABA-based program. Other approaches that are not typically included in strict DTT include errorless teaching procedures and Fluency-Based Instruction (FBI). References Baer, D., Wolf, M., & Risley, R. (1968).

Reliable Measurement ABA is an objective discipline. ABA focuses on the reliable measurement and objective evaluation of observable behavior. Reliable Measurement (RM) requires that behaviors are defined objectively. Vague terms, such as anger, depression, aggression, or tantrums are redefined in observable and quantifiable terms, so their frequency, duration, or other measurable properties can be directly recorded (Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1991). For example, a goal to reduce a individual\u2019s aggressive behavior might define \u201caggression\u201d as: \u201cattempts, episodes or occurrences (each separated by 10 seconds) of biting, scratching, pinching, or pulling hair.\u201d \u201cInitiating social interaction with peers\u201d might be defined as \u201clooking at a classmate and verbalizing an appropriate greeting.\u201d ABA interventions require a demonstration of the events that are responsible for the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of behavior. ABA uses methods of analysis that yield convincing, reproducible, and conceptually sensible demonstrations of how to accomplish specific behavior changes (Baer & Risley, 1987). Moreover, these behaviors are evaluated within relevant settings, such as schools, homes, and the community. The use of single-case experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of individualized interventions is an essential component of programs based upon ABA methodologies. This process includes the following components: Selection of interfering behavior or behavioral skill deficit; Identification of goals and objectives; Establishment of a method of measuring target behaviors; Evaluation of the current levels of performance (baseline); Design and implementation of the interventions that teach new skills and/or reduce interfering behaviors; Continuous measurement of target behaviors to determine the effectiveness of the intervention; and Ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention, with modifications made as necessary to maintain and/or increase both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the intervention (MADSEC, 2000, p. 21-23). As the MADSEC report describes above, treatment approaches grounded in ABA are now considered to be the gold standard of therapeutic and educational interventions for individuals with autism. The large amount of scientific evidence supporting ABA treatments for individuals with autism has led a number of other independent bodies to endorse the effectiveness of ABA, including the U.S. Surgeon General, the New York State Department of Health, the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (see reference list below for sources). Socially Significant Behaviors \u201cSocially significant behaviors\u201d include reading, academics, social skills, communication, and adaptive living skills. \u201cAdaptive living skills\u201d include gross and fine motor skills, eating and food preparation, toileting, dressing, personal self-care, domestic skills, time and punctuality, money and value, home and community orientation, and work skills. ABA methods are used to support individuals with autism in at least six ways: To increase behaviors (e.g., reinforcement procedures to increase on-task behavior or social interactions); To teach new skills (e.g., systematic instruction and reinforcement procedures to teach functional life skills, communication skills, or social skills); To maintain behaviors (e.g., teaching self-control and self-monitoring procedures to maintain and generalize job-related social skills); To generalize or to transfer behavior from one situation or response to another (e.g., from completing assignments in the resource room to performing as well in the mainstream classroom); To restrict or narrow conditions under which interfering behaviors occur (e.g., modifying the learning environment); and To reduce interfering behaviors (e.g., self-injury or stereotypy).

Department of Health and Human Services, Reliable Measurement ABA is an objective discipline. ABA focuses on the reliable measurement and objective evaluation of observable behavior. Reliable Measurement (RM) requires that behaviors are defined objectively. Vague terms, such as anger, depression, aggression, or tantrums are redefined in observable and quantifiable terms, so their frequency, duration, or other measurable properties can be directly recorded (Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1991). For example, a goal to reduce a individual\u2019s aggressive behavior might define \u201caggression\u201d as: \u201cattempts, episodes or occurrences (each separated by 10 seconds) of biting, scratching, pinching, or pulling hair.\u201d \u201cInitiating social interaction with peers\u201d might be defined as \u201clooking at a classmate and verbalizing an appropriate greeting.\u201d ABA interventions require a demonstration of the events that are responsible for the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of behavior. ABA uses methods of analysis that yield convincing, reproducible, and conceptually sensible demonstrations of how to accomplish specific behavior changes (Baer & Risley, 1987). Moreover, these behaviors are evaluated within relevant settings, such as schools, homes, and the community. The use of single-case experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of individualized interventions is an essential component of programs based upon ABA methodologies. This process includes the following components: Selection of interfering behavior or behavioral skill deficit; Identification of goals and objectives; Establishment of a method of measuring target behaviors; Evaluation of the current levels of performance (baseline); Design and implementation of the interventions that teach new skills and/or reduce interfering behaviors; Continuous measurement of target behaviors to determine the effectiveness of the intervention; and Ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention, with modifications made as necessary to maintain and/or increase both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the intervention (MADSEC, 2000, p. 21-23). Selection of interfering behavior or behavioral skill deficit; Identification of goals and objectives; Establishment of a method of measuring target behaviors; Evaluation of the current levels of performance (baseline); Design and implementation of the interventions that teach new skills and/or reduce interfering behaviors; Continuous measurement of target behaviors to determine the effectiveness of the intervention; and Ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention, with modifications made as necessary to maintain and/or increase both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the intervention (MADSEC, 2000, p. 21-23). As the MADSEC report describes above, treatment approaches grounded in ABA are now considered to be the gold standard of therapeutic and educational interventions for individuals with autism. The large amount of scientific evidence supporting ABA treatments for individuals with autism has led a number of other independent bodies to endorse the effectiveness of ABA, including the U.S. Surgeon General, the New York State Department of Health, the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (see reference list below for sources). Socially Significant Behaviors \u201cSocially significant behaviors\u201d include reading, academics, social skills, communication, and adaptive living skills. \u201cAdaptive living skills\u201d include gross and fine motor skills, eating and food preparation, toileting, dressing, personal self-care, domestic skills, time and punctuality, money and value, home and community orientation, and work skills. ABA methods are used to support individuals with autism in at least six ways:  To increase behaviors (e.g., reinforcement procedures to increase on-task behavior or social interactions); To teach new skills (e.g., systematic instruction and reinforcement procedures to teach functional life skills, communication skills, or social skills); To maintain behaviors (e.g., teaching self-control and self-monitoring procedures to maintain and generalize job-related social skills); To generalize or to transfer behavior from one situation or response to another (e.g., from completing assignments in the resource room to performing as well in the mainstream classroom); To restrict or narrow conditions under which interfering behaviors occur (e.g., modifying the learning environment); and To reduce interfering behaviors (e.g., self-injury or stereotypy).

We know that children with autism have the greatest long-term success when treatment is started as early as possible. This early intervention is key to maximizing progress for our patients and building the foundation for lifelong learning. Our expertly skilled team of clinicians are specialists in both Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and working directly with children diagnosed with ASD. We provide each patient a custom-tailored treatment plan that is unique to their needs. CARD is dedicated to supporting each child and family as they begin their early intervention journey Why is early intervention so important? The first few years of a child\u2019s life are the most impactful for development, with new skills being learned very quickly. A child\u2019s brain develops rapidly during this time and is primed to learning new skills and behaviors. Because of this, children are more likely to benefit the most from treatment when provided at a young age (18 months -4 years). Behavioral intervention is most impactful when it occurs during this window of time and is most likely to result in optimal outcomes for each child. With autism spectrum disorder being diagnosed as early as 2 years of age, it is critical for each child to begin treatment as soon as possible. Skills learned in early intervention programs have the greatest chance of leading to lasting, meaningful growth and lifelong success for our patients. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is the only therapy approved by the U.S. Surgeon General in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders. Studies have shown a higher success rate from those who started interventions such as ABA during earlier years of development as compared to starting at older ages. While it is clear that all individuals with ASD can benefit greatly from ABA, early intervention is critical for maximizing progress and giving children the best chance of future success. What does early intervention look like? Much like all our treatment programs, CARD\u2019s early intervention programs are individualized according to the specific needs of each child and the priorities of the caregivers and family. Each program will have unique goals and targets and be especially tailored to the child\u2019s preferences and motivations. All CARD early intervention programs use evidence-based ABA methodologies and combine naturalistic and structured ABA strategies to maximize your child\u2019s learning. CARD early intervention programs also have a strong emphasis on learning through play, and strive to teach targeted skills in meaningful, engaging ways. Learning should be fun! Programs also emphasize skills that lead to lifelong success and learning. Communication skills, social awareness and engagement, learning readiness, and challenging behavior reduction are some of the primary areas prioritized that provide a foundation for future growth.
